## Introduction
This project aims to forecast petrol prices using ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models. The project uses historical petrol price data to make future predictions.

## Data
The dataset used in this project contains historical petrol prices and is divided into training and testing sets (`train_data.csv` and `test_data.csv`).

## Methodology
This project uses the following time-series forecasting models:
- ARIMA
- LSTM
